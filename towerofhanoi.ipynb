    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi is a well known mathematical puzzle from 1883. You are given three pegs which hold a number of circular disks of different sizes. The disks all start on the furthest left peg, and you must move the entire tower to the furthest right peg, one disk at a time, obeying a simple rule: you may not put a disk on top of a smaller disk.\n",

    "There is a Python module in this project which implements the Tower of Hanoi game called `hanoi.py`. You do not need to look at the code â€“ you can if you wish, but I suggest working through this entire notebook once first. It contains a class called `HanoiState` which allows us to represent the state of the puzzle. When you create a new state with no additional arguments, it will create the starting state for a 5-disk puzzle:"

As the result at the end of the code shows, our breadth first search found a sequence of moves which was optimal.
